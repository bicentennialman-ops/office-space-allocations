### Solution for Office Space Allocations 

1. Count free units for each floor
2. Backtracking floors
3. Attribute order of precedence
    * Use the least floors
    * Adjacent floors (with the formula happier^2)
    * Adjacent unit (with the formula happier^2)



> **_NOTE:_** ```happier^2``` an abstraction of satisfaction by squaring
